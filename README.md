# Trajectory Simplification via RL
This is the implemention of our paper "Trajectory Simplification via RL"

## Requirements

* Python >= 3.5 (Anaconda3 is recommended and 3.6 is tested)
* Tensorflow (1.8.0 is tested)

## Dataset & Preprocessing

Download & unzip the dataset [Geolife](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/b16d359d-d164-469e-9fd4-daa38f2b2e13/) and put its folder into `./TrajData`. Note that the input data generated by [`preprocess.py`](preprocess.py) will also be stored in this folder.

```
python preprocess.py
```
### Current Job

Mainly work in batch-rlts part.

Debug with [`simplifier.py`](simplifier.py), [`geometry.py`](geometry.py) and [`poly.py`](poly.py)  with one simple 2-dimnentional trajectory data.
